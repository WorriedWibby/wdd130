        <h2>Client Report</h2>
        <p>
            My experience as a client was interesting to say the least.
            Since this was going to website that I wanted someone else to design, I tried to put in as much detail as possible.
            I chose videogames as the content for my website, because I like videogames. Some day I even hope to make them myself.
            A website for videogames may also be helpful to me when I start marketing my own games.
            I chose to focus on games I enjoy for the moment as a proof of concept, but my plan is to expand on it later.
            <br><br>
            I tried to communicate with my lead developer using email, but the main issue I had was I wouldn't receive any messages back.
            in fact, I still haven't seen my website yet, as I haven't received a link to view it.
            I was told that this was his best email, but I feel like in the future I would discuss with my lead developer on the best way to contact them.
            <br><br>
            I can't that my developers met my expectations for my website, because there is no website for me to take a look at.
            Which is unfortunate because I was looking forward to seeing how my website was coming along.
            <br><br>
            I feel like the biggest thing I would do differently, is change the way I communicate with my developers.
            By making sure that we have a good communication line and that I receive frequent updates.
        </p>

        <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
        <p>As a lead developer, I tried my best to make sure that the work I did would be easily used by the rest of my team.
            I sent, emails after each commit letting my team know the progress I made with the HTML and CSS.
            I made sure that they had access to the website link.
            And when one of my junior developers reached out to me for help, I tried my best to help them solve the problem.
            <br><br>
            I communicated to my client using email, and I sent him the link to the website so he could have access to it.
            I also asked him to send me feedback, but he never did. So, I hope that the website meets his expectations.
            We did talk over text around the start of the project, where I expressed some of my concerns of being able to make some of the things he wanted which would have required JavaScript.
            He assured me at the time, that it was only what he was thinking at the time and that I didn't have to do it if it was too difficult.
            Which was kind of him, and took a lot off of my shoulders.
            <br><br>
            I published the website using GitHubs free publishing services, and provided my client with its link.
            Overall, managing GitHub was relatively easy. This was mostly because I have a bit of experience with it in the past.
        </p>

        <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
        <p>My experience as a junior developer was interesting, communication wasn't great.
            One of my lead developers' used Discord, which was great when we communicated.
            But it was terrible when we weren't. For example, the lead developer didn't make a link for the website until the start week.
            The other lead developer rarely made contact, and it was mostly over email.
            <br><br>
            Apart from being given the site plan, I didn't know what was expected of me.
            So, for the most part I just chose a child page and started wokring on it.
            <br><br>
            I was able to contribute, to Bree's website. This was because the lead develoepr got the index.html and the style.css page to us as early as possible.
            Unfortunately Hewitt's webpage did not see any work done to it until this week.
            And the work wasn't done by the lead developer, but rather the other junior developer.
            <br><br>
            For Bree's site, the only issue I came across was not receiving the link for the server until it was too late.
            And for Hewitt's website, I didn't receive an invite until start of the second week. And there was no index.html or style.ccs until it was too late.
        </p>

        <h2>General Experience</h2>
        <p>The biggest challenge for me was communication, and I know it was partially my fault, especially for my team.
            I wasn't able to overcome it in time, but it has given me good insight on how to handle it in the future.
            For my team I should have established the best ways to communicate as soon as possible.
            And for the other teams, I probably should have pushed them more.
            It was unfortunate that I was away for a week, because I could have talked to my teams in person to solve the situation much sooner.
            <br><br>
            Even though the communication was bad, the best thing about this project was the fact we had to work in teams.
            As a lead developer, it made me think about what I was building in CSS.
            I was often thinking about how I could use classes to make it easier when my junior developers were working on their pages.
            And I liked the fact that I had to be cleaner with my CSS in order to acheive that.
            <br><br>
            If I haven't expressed it enough already, then I will express it again.
            I would make sure that communication lines were established way before we started.
            I would bug my teams to hold at least a weekly meeting, so then we all would be on the same page.
            And I would make sure that everyone got the memo.
            <br><br>
            I do feel more confident in working on real world projects, because I now have a better idea of what to expect.
            I know that the teams I will work with in the future can be just as chaotic as the ones I worked with on this project.
            And now I have some ideas on how to better handle those kinds of teams in the future.
